    <h1>Chad Lengefeld</h1>      
    <p>Currently employed at Indeed via Staffmark, working on the Indeed Prime product. I'm always searching for a 
        challenge and consider myself a dynamic individual who enjoys technology, nature, science, and how systems interact in all
         kinds of ways throughout our lives. My interests cover a wide spectrum, from cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to aquaponic vertical gardening and rock climbing.
          I also have accumulated over fifteen years of research and experience with nutrition, physiology, and the pursuit of physical and mental excellence. Let's have a chat,
         I have a lot of knowledge to share and I'd love to learn something from you. </p>
